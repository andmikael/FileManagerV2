# FileManagerV2

[preview version hosted in Azure](https://gentle-plant-08ad8f103.4.azurestaticapps.net)

A webapp to manage Microsoft Azure Blob Storage containers and blobs

Allows you to create, delete and select existing Blob containers in the storage account.
Inside a Blob container you can upload and download files from/to your device

Uses Angularv19 for frontend and Java Spring / Springboot for backend

This is a more polished version of my earlier [Java only project](https://github.com/andmikael/FileManager) with the same name that is also being hosted in Azure.
